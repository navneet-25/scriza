ðŸš€ Getting Started
To set up the project locally and run the Next.js development server, follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies
Before you can start the project, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the necessary npm packages by running the following command in your project directory:

Copy code
```bash
npm install
```
This will download all the required dependencies specified in the package.json file, setting up your projectâ€™s environment.

2. Start the Development Server
Once the installation is complete, youâ€™re ready to start the local development server! Run the following command:

Copy code
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will spin up the Next.js development server at http://localhost:3000 (by default). Open your browser and navigate to that address to see your application in action.

3. Explore and Develop
Now you're all set! You can edit files in the pages or components directories, and the changes will automatically reflect in your browser thanks to hot-reloading. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
